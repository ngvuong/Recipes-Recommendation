# **Capstone Project 1 Proposal**
## **Food and Nutrition: Recipe Recommendation**

* What is the problem you want to solve?
In my own personal experience, oftentimes the task of figuring out what to eat or what recipe to make can be daunting. This can be true whether you’re just fixing a quick bite to eat or planning out meals to fit nutritional goals or maybe you feel a bit adventurous and want to explore with a dish you’ve never tried before.  Things can get especially overwhelming considering the sheer amount of options in terms of ingredients and styles of recipe. On the other hand, there are situations with a seeming lack of choice wherein the list of ingredients might be limited but you wonder what you can possibly throw together. How could this process be simplified and streamlined so that you don’t need to look at a few dozen youtube videos for inspiration.
* Who is your client and why do they care about this problem?
There is a wide range of possibilities regarding who the client could be depending on the complexity of this project. Nutrient tracking apps like Myfitnesspal, should they wish to expand their repertoire would be a potential client especially considering their already robust nutritions database. On a smaller scale, a product like this could see everyday people being direct clients. Most people lead busy lives and potentially saving them time is invaluable.
* What data are you using? How will you acquire the data?
I will be using a dataset from Kaggle which comprises of recipe and nutritional data scraped from Epicurious. While the dataset seems robust, there is always room for the addition of more recipe possibilities should that be appropriate/ necessary. One possibility is directly expanding upon the recipe list to include more representation of types of food that may be lacking. Another method of expansion could be merging this dataset with more nutritional detail on individual ingredients. As it stands, the current data only provides nutritional info on the complete dish.
* Briefly outline how you’ll solve this problem.
Considering that this problem has its roots in the potential complexities in a process, naturally the goal would be to simplify it. As such, I would try to package the product in a way as to keep user in one place. The idea is to take into account a user’s preferences and goals and suggest potential meals fitting nutritional goals/ ingredients list. Some statistics on the recipe dataset itself will be explored. This information can then be leveraged for insight on various distributions like recipe and ingredient types. Furthermore, recipes can potentially be categorized according to culture, healthiness, etc….
* What are your deliverables? Typically, this includes code, a paper, or a slide deck.
Deliverables would include code for a demonstration of how the product works. Additionally, a paper or post would work well for explaining the motivation and technical details behind the solution.
